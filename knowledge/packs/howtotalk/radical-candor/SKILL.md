# Radical Candor (래디컬 캔더)

> "It's not mean. It's clear." — Kim Scott

## Core Model: The 2x2 Matrix (2x2 매트릭스)

```
                    Challenge Directly (직접적으로 도전)
                         HIGH
                          |
         Obnoxious    |        Radical
         Aggression   |        Candor
         (불쾌한 공격)  |   (래디컬 캔더 - 솔직한 배려)
                          |
  LOW ----+---------------+---------------+---- HIGH
          |               |               |
  Care    |  Manipulative |   Ruinous     |  Care
  Person- |  Insincerity  |   Empathy     |  Person-
  ally    | (조작적 불성실) | (파멸적 공감)   |  ally
          |               |               |
                         LOW
                    Challenge Directly
```

### The Four Quadrants (4분면)

| Quadrant | Care | Challenge | Result |
|----------|------|-----------|--------|
| **Radical Candor** (래디컬 캔더) | HIGH | HIGH | Growth + Trust |
| **Ruinous Empathy** (파멸적 공감) | HIGH | LOW | Stagnation — "nice but unhelpful" |
| **Obnoxious Aggression** (불쾌한 공격) | LOW | HIGH | Fear — "brutal honesty without care" |
| **Manipulative Insincerity** (조작적 불성실) | LOW | LOW | Backstabbing, politics, passive-aggression |

### Prerequisite: Psychological Safety (Amy Edmondson)

Radical Candor only works in environments with **psychological safety** -- the belief that you won't be punished for speaking up.

Without psychological safety:
- "Challenge Directly" becomes career suicide
- Feedback flows only downward, never upward
- People perform Ruinous Empathy to survive

**How to build psychological safety (before attempting Radical Candor):**
1. **Leader goes first** -- share YOUR mistakes, ask for feedback on yourself
2. **Respond to bad news with curiosity, not punishment** -- "Tell me more" instead of "How did you let this happen?"
3. **Celebrate "useful failures" and learning** -- normalize that mistakes are data, not character flaws
4. **Make it safe to say "I don't know"** -- model intellectual humility from the top

Without this foundation, Radical Candor degenerates:
- In fear-based cultures, "Challenge Directly" reads as Obnoxious Aggression
- People who try Radical Candor upward get labeled as "difficult" or "not a team player"
- The 2x2 matrix becomes purely theoretical -- everyone defaults to Ruinous Empathy or Manipulative Insincerity for self-preservation

**Assessment:** Before rolling out Radical Candor in a team, ask: "Could the most junior person in this room tell the most senior person they're wrong -- and feel safe doing so?" If the answer is no, start with psychological safety.

### The "Um" Story (김스콧의 결정적 순간)

After a successful presentation at Google, Sheryl Sandberg pulled Kim aside. She praised what went well, then said: "You said 'um' a lot. Were you aware of it?" Kim brushed it off. Sheryl escalated: "I can see I'm going to have to be more direct. When you say 'um' every third word, it makes you sound stupid." That directness — delivered with genuine care — changed Kim's career. Sheryl wasn't being mean; she cared enough to be clear.

## Process: Giving Feedback (피드백 제공 프로세스)

### Step 1: Check Your Quadrant (분면 확인)

Before speaking, ask yourself:
- Am I showing I **care personally** about this person? (개인적으로 관심을 보이는가?)
- Am I **challenging directly** — saying what I actually think? (직접적으로 도전하는가?)

If either answer is "no", adjust before proceeding.

### Step 2: Use the SBI Framework (SBI 프레임워크)

| Element | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **S**ituation (상황) | When and where | "In yesterday's client meeting..." |
| **B**ehavior (행동) | What they did (observable) | "...you interrupted the client three times..." |
| **I**mpact (영향) | The effect | "...which made them visibly frustrated and they cut the meeting short." |

### Step 3: Be Humble, Not Arrogant (겸손하게, 오만하지 않게)

- State your perception, not "the truth": "I noticed..." not "You always..."
- Invite their perspective: "Am I reading this right?" (내가 맞게 보고 있나요?)
- Be open to being wrong

### Step 4: Give Feedback Immediately (즉시 피드백)

- Don't save it for the 1:1 or review cycle
- 2-3 minutes after the event, not 2-3 weeks
- In private for criticism, in public for praise (비판은 사석에서, 칭찬은 공석에서)

### Step 5: Praise More Than Criticize (비판보다 칭찬을 더 많이)

- Ratio: aim for 3-5 praise for every 1 criticism
- Praise must be **specific** — "great job" is Ruinous Empathy
- Radical Candor praise: SBI format with genuine enthusiasm

## Process: Receiving Feedback (피드백 수용 프로세스)

### Step 1: Embrace the Discomfort (불편함을 받아들여라)

- Your first instinct will be to defend. Resist it.
- Count to 6 before responding. (반응하기 전 6초를 세라)

### Step 2: Listen to Understand (이해하기 위해 들어라)

- Reward the candor: "Thank you for telling me this."
- Ask clarifying questions: "Can you give me an example?"
- Do NOT explain or justify yet.

### Step 3: Manage Your Response (반응을 관리하라)

- If you disagree: "I want to think about this. Can we talk again tomorrow?"
- If you agree: "You're right, and here's what I'll do differently."
- Either way: follow up. (어떤 경우든 후속 조치)

## Anti-patterns (하지 말아야 할 것들)

1. **The Feedback Sandwich** (피드백 샌드위치) — Praise-Criticism-Praise dilutes the message and feels manipulative. Just be direct.

2. **Waiting for the Annual Review** (연말 평가까지 기다리기) — Feedback has a half-life. Deliver within 48 hours or the moment is lost.

3. **"Just being honest"** ("그냥 솔직한 거야") — This is Obnoxious Aggression disguised as virtue. Honesty without care is cruelty.

4. **Vague Praise** (모호한 칭찬) — "Good job" teaches nothing. Specify what was good and why it mattered.

5. **Criticizing in Public** (공개적 비판) — Always criticize in private. Public criticism triggers shame, not growth.

6. **Personalizing the Feedback** (인격에 대한 피드백) — "You're lazy" vs "The report was submitted 3 days late." Attack the behavior, not the person.

7. **The Retrospective Dump** (과거 몰아치기) — Don't store up 6 months of grievances and unload them at once.

8. **Assuming Your Intent Is Obvious** (의도가 당연히 전달된다고 가정) — Always state your care explicitly: "I'm telling you this because I want you to succeed."
